Ten currently implements these functional programming concepts through its core architecture:

Recursively Defined Dependency Graph: The BuildGraph type and associated operations.
Inductive Proofs About Builds: The Proof system with composition (ComposeProof).
Functorial Operations: Throughout the codebase, especially in monadic operations and graph processing.
Type-Level Phase Tracking: Using Phase at the type level to enforce separation.

These implementations form the foundation of Ten as a research platform for build system concepts, allowing it to explore new ideas with strong formal guarantees.
For Ten to further evolve as a prototyping platform, it could incorporate more advanced concepts from functional programming, such as:

Effect Typing: More granular control over effects during builds
Dependent Types: Stronger guarantees about build correctness
Free Monads/Applicatives: More declarative build specifications
Advanced Recursion Schemes: For more efficient graph processing and dependency resolution
