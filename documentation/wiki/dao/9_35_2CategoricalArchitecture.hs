-- 2-Categorical Architecture for Ten Build System: A Comprehensive Analysis

{- Understanding Ten as a 2-Category

Ten's phase system can be modeled using 2-categorical structure.

The 2-Categorical Structure of Ten
Objects (0-cells)       : Phases (Eval, Build)
1-morphisms (1-cells)   : Phase transitions and operations
2-morphisms (2-cells)   : Proofs and transformations between operations

This isn't merely theoretical - it provides a powerful lens for understanding and enhancing Ten's architecture.

Phase Categories and Their Operations
Eval Phase as Category
The Eval phase forms a category where:

Objects are evaluation-stage entities (expressions, unevaluated derivations)
Morphisms are evaluation operations:
-}

-- These are morphisms in the Eval category
mkDerivation :: Text -> StorePath -> [Text] -> Set DerivationInput -> Set Text -> Map Text Text -> TenM 'Eval Derivation
createBuildGraph :: Set StorePath -> Set Derivation -> TenM 'Eval BuildGraph
validateGraph :: BuildGraph -> TenM 'Eval GraphProof

{-
Build Phase as Category
The Build phase forms another category where:

Objects are build-stage entities (derivations, build outputs)
Morphisms are build operations:
-}

-- These are morphisms in the Build category
buildDerivation :: Derivation -> TenM 'Build BuildResult
collectBuildResult :: Derivation -> FilePath -> TenM 'Build (Set StorePath)
withSandbox :: Set StorePath -> SandboxConfig -> (FilePath -> TenM 'Build a) -> TenM 'Build a

{-
Phase Transitions as Functors
The transition from Eval to Build is a functor that preserves the structure:
-}

-- Currently implicit, could be made explicit:
evalToBuild :: TenM 'Eval Derivation -> TenM 'Build Derivation
evalToBuild evalAction = TenM $ do
  env <- ask
  state <- get
  case runTen evalAction env (initBuildState Eval) of
    Left err -> throwError err
    Right (deriv, _) -> return deriv

-- This functor preserves composition and identity - evaluation results remain coherent when moved to the build phase.

{-
Proofs as Natural Transformations
The proof system elegantly fits as natural transformations:
-}

-- Natural transformation between identity functor and "verified" functor
proveType :: TenM 'Eval Derivation -> TenM 'Eval (Derivation, Proof 'Eval)
proveType derivM = do
  deriv <- derivM
  -- Verification logic
  return (deriv, TypeProof)

-- Natural transformation between build functors
proveOutput :: TenM 'Build BuildResult -> TenM 'Build (BuildResult, Proof 'Build)
proveOutput buildM = do
  result <- buildM
  -- Verify outputs exist
  return (result, OutputProof)


{- Architectural Improvements -}

{- 1. Formalized Phase Transition Functors -}
-- Explicit functor from Eval to Build
evalToBuild :: Functor f => f (TenM 'Eval a) -> f (TenM 'Build a)
evalToBuild = fmap $ \evalAction -> TenM $ do
  env <- ask
  state <- get
  case runTen evalAction env (initBuildState Eval) of
    Left err -> throwError err
    Right (a, _) -> return a

-- With laws enforced:
-- evalToBuild (f >=> g) ≡ evalToBuild f >=> evalToBuild g
-- evalToBuild return ≡ return

-- Benefits: Type-safe phase transitions with guaranteed structure preservation.

{- 2. Horizontal Composition of Proofs -}
-- Horizontal composition of proofs (currently missing)
horizComposeProof :: (a -> b) -> Proof p -> (b -> c) -> Proof p -> (a -> c) -> Proof p
horizComposeProof f proofF g proofG = ComposeProof proofF proofG

-- Example use:
buildWithProof :: Derivation -> TenM 'Build (BuildResult, Proof 'Build)
buildWithProof deriv = do
  -- Compose proofs horizontally across the build pipeline
  (deriv', inputProof) <- prepareInputs deriv
  (result, buildProof) <- doBuild deriv'
  return (result, horizComposeProof prepareInputs inputProof doBuild buildProof)

-- Benefits: Compositional reasoning about correctness across the build pipeline.

{- 3. Advanced Proof Combinators -}
-- 2-categorical proof combinators
whiskeredProof :: (a -> b) -> Proof p -> (b -> b') -> (a -> b') -> Proof p
whiskeredProof f proof g = whiskeringTransformation proof g

-- Interchange law enforced:
-- (p ∘ᵥ q) ∘ₕ (r ∘ᵥ s) ≡ (p ∘ₕ r) ∘ᵥ (q ∘ₕ s)
interchange :: Proof p -> Proof p -> Proof p -> Proof p -> Proof p

-- Benefits: Rigorous proof composition with mathematical guarantees.

{- 4. Functorial Caching -}
-- Cache as a 2-functor
cacheAsFunctor :: (TenM p a -> TenM p b) -> (TenM p a -> TenM p b)
cacheAsFunctor operation = \input -> do
  cacheKey <- computeCacheKey input
  cachedResult <- lookupCache cacheKey
  case cachedResult of
    Just result -> return result
    Nothing -> do
      result <- operation input
      storeInCache cacheKey result
      return result

-- Benefits: Principled caching with structure preservation guarantees.


{- Specific Areas for Implementation -}
{- 1. Core Phase Transition System
The primary area to implement 2-categorical structure is the phase transition system: -}

-- Explicit 2-category structure in core
module Ten.Core.TwoCategory where

-- Phases are 0-cells
data Phase = Eval | Build

-- 1-cells are functors between phases
data PhaseTransition p q where
  EvalToBuild :: PhaseTransition 'Eval 'Build
  IdentityEval :: PhaseTransition 'Eval 'Eval
  IdentityBuild :: PhaseTransition 'Build 'Build

-- 2-cells are transformations between transitions
data TransformProof p q f g where
  -- Transformations between phase transitions
  TransProof :: (forall a. f (TenM p a) -> g (TenM q a)) -> TransformProof p q f g

{- 2. Proof Composition System
The proof system would benefit from explicit 2-categorical composition: -}

-- Enhanced proof composition
data EnhancedProof p where
  -- Basic proofs as before
  BasicProof :: Proof p -> EnhancedProof p

  -- Vertical composition (within the same phase)
  VertComp :: EnhancedProof p -> EnhancedProof p -> EnhancedProof p

  -- Horizontal composition (across operations)
  HorizComp :: (a -> b) -> EnhancedProof p -> (b -> c) -> EnhancedProof p -> EnhancedProof p

  -- Whiskering (extending transformations)
  Whisker :: (a -> b) -> EnhancedProof p -> (b -> c) -> EnhancedProof p

{- 3. Build Graph Analysis
The dependency graph system could leverage 2-categorical structure: -}

-- Graph operations as 2-functors
optimizeGraph :: BuildGraph -> BuildGraph
optimizeGraph = -- implementation

-- 2-natural transformations between graph operations
optimizationProof :: (BuildGraph -> TenM 'Eval a) -> (BuildGraph -> TenM 'Eval a)
optimizationProof operation = operation . optimizeGraph

{-
Benefits of 2-Categorical Architecture

Formal Correctness: 2-categorical laws provide mathematical guarantees about system behavior
Compositional Reasoning: Complex build pipelines can be reasoned about compositionally
Optimization Opportunities: Category-theoretic principles enable systematic optimizations:

Functor fusion for performance
Proof simplification based on categorical laws
Caching optimizations using representability


Type Safety: Enhanced type system can enforce phase-specific constraints
Modularity: Components can be composed and transformed without breaking abstractions

-- With laws enforced through property testing
prop_functor_laws :: Property
prop_functor_laws = forAll genEvalActions $ \(f, g) ->
  evalToBuild (f >=> g) === evalToBuild f >=> evalToBuild g

{- 2. Enhanced Proof Composition -}
-- Implement enhanced proof composition
module Ten.Proof.Composition where

-- Vertical composition (already present as ComposeProof)
verticalCompose :: Proof p -> Proof p -> Proof p
verticalCompose = ComposeProof

-- Horizontal composition (new)
horizontalCompose :: Proof p -> Proof p -> Proof p
horizontalCompose p1 p2 = -- implementation

-- Whiskering operations
leftWhisker :: (a -> TenM p b) -> Proof p -> Proof p
rightWhisker :: Proof p -> (a -> TenM p b) -> Proof p

{- 3. 2-Categorical Build Graph -}
-- Implement 2-categorical build graph operations
module Ten.Graph.TwoCategory where

-- Graph as a 2-functor
data GraphFunctor a = GraphFunctor
  { mapNodes :: (BuildNode -> BuildNode) -> a -> a
  , mapEdges :: (Text -> Text) -> a -> a
  }

-- Natural transformations for graph optimizations
graphOptimization :: GraphFunctor BuildGraph
graphOptimization = GraphFunctor
  { mapNodes = optimizeNodes
  , mapEdges = removeRedundantEdges
  }

{-
Rational Justification
The 2-categorical approach provides several concrete benefits:

Correctness Guarantees: Build systems must ensure correctness; categorical laws provide mathematical guarantees
Performance Optimization: Functorial structure enables systematic optimizations like fusion and memoization
Code Organization: The 2-categorical structure provides natural boundaries for code organization
Advanced Features: Modern build systems need advanced features like incremental builds and parallel execution, which become more manageable in a 2-categorical framework
Research Value: Ten as a research platform benefits from exploring these advanced concepts

Conclusion
Adopting a 2-categorical architecture for Ten provides a rigorous mathematical foundation with practical benefits for correctness, performance, and extensibility. The phase system, proof composition, and build graph analysis are the most promising areas for implementation.
This approach aligns perfectly with Ten's goals as an architectural prototyping platform for build systems, enabling exploration of advanced build system concepts with strong formal guarantees.
