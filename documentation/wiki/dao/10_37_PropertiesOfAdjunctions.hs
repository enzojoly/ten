-- Properties of Adjunctions

{- Current Implementation: Ten's build system preserves dependency structures but doesn't explicitly leverage adjunction properties: -}

-- Current implementation handles dependencies case by case
validateGraph :: BuildGraph -> TenM 'Eval GraphProof
buildDerivation :: Derivation -> TenM 'Build BuildResult
{- Potential Enhancement: Leverage adjoint functor properties for optimizations: -}

-- Using the fact that right adjoints preserve limits
incrementalRebuild :: (BuildPlan -> BuildPlan) -> TenM 'Build (Limit BuildResult)
