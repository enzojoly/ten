-- Free Monads for Extensible DSL

{-
The concept of Free Monads is directly applicable to Ten's goals as a prototyping platform.
A free monad approach would allow Ten to:

Define a pure, extensible DSL for build operations
Separate the description of builds from their interpretation
Support multiple interpreters for the same build description
Enable static analysis of build plans before execution
-}

-- Implementation could look like:

-- Free monad for build operations
data BuildF next
  = ReadInput FilePath (ByteString -> next)
  | WriteOutput FilePath ByteString next
  | Execute Command (ExitCode -> next)
  | ReadEnvironment (BuildEnv -> next)
  deriving Functor

type BuildDSL = Free BuildF

-- Multiple interpreters
interpretRealBuild :: BuildDSL a -> IO a
interpretMockBuild :: BuildDSL a -> State MockState a
interpretAnalyze :: BuildDSL a -> [BuildStep]
