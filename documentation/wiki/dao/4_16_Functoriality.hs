{-
Functoriality in Ten: Properties and Relationships to Preserve
When defining explicit functors for build operations in Ten, several critical properties and relationships must be preserved:
1. Dependency Relationships
Properties to preserve:

Direct dependencies: If package A depends on package B in the original dependency graph, this relationship must be maintained after transformation.
Transitive dependencies: If A depends on B and B depends on C, then A's indirect dependency on C must be preserved.
-}

-- Current implicit approach
topologicalSort :: BuildGraph -> TenM 'Eval [BuildNode]

-- Could be enhanced with an explicit functor
newtype DependencyPreservingF a = DependencyPreservingF {
  runDPF :: BuildGraph -> TenM 'Eval a
}

instance Functor DependencyPreservingF where
  fmap f (DependencyPreservingF g) = DependencyPreservingF $ \graph -> do
    result <- g graph
    -- Verify dependency preservation invariants
    return (f result)

{-
2. Graph Structure Properties
Properties to preserve:

Acyclicity: No cycles can be introduced or removed during transformation
Closure completeness: All required dependencies remain in the graph
Reachability: All paths to required outputs remain intact
-}

-- Example from Ten's codebase:
validateGraph :: BuildGraph -> TenM 'Eval GraphProof
validateGraph graph = do
    -- Check for cycles
    hasCycles <- detectCycles graph
    when hasCycles $
        throwError $ GraphError "Dependency cycle detected in build graph"

    -- Check for completeness (all dependencies are present)
    isComplete <- checkCompleteness graph
    unless isComplete $
        throwError $ GraphError "Build graph is missing some dependencies"

{-
3. Build Determinism
Properties to preserve:

Input-output mapping: Same inputs must produce same outputs after transformation
Hash consistency: Content-addressable properties must be maintained
Reproducibility guarantees: Any proofs about build reproducibility must remain valid
-}

-- Potential implementation:

-- A functor that preserves determinism properties when transforming builds
newtype DeterministicBuildF a = DeterministicBuildF {
  runDBF :: Derivation -> TenM 'Build (a, BuildResult)
}

instance Functor DeterministicBuildF where
  fmap f (DeterministicBuildF g) = DeterministicBuildF $ \drv -> do
    (x, result) <- g drv
    -- Verify determinism hasn't been broken
    verifyBuildResult drv result
    return (f x, result)

{-
4. Phase Separation
Properties to preserve:

Type-level phase boundaries: Eval vs Build phase separation must be maintained
Effect isolation: Effects permitted in one phase cannot leak into the other
Proof validity: Proofs about phases must remain valid after transformation
-}

-- Current implementation basis:
-- Ten already preserves this at the type level
newtype TenM (p :: Phase) a = TenM
  { runTenM :: ReaderT BuildEnv (StateT BuildState (ExceptT BuildError IO)) a }

{-
5. Categorical Properties
Properties to preserve:

Composition: If g ∘ f is a valid composition, then T(g ∘ f) = T(g) ∘ T(f) must hold
Identity: Id maps to Id after transformation
Associativity: (f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h) must be preserved
-}

-- Potential implementation:

-- Build operation category
data BuildOp a b where
  BuildStep :: (a -> TenM 'Build b) -> BuildOp a b
  ComposeOp :: BuildOp b c -> BuildOp a b -> BuildOp a c
  IdOp :: BuildOp a a

-- Functor that transforms build operations while preserving categorical properties
buildOpFunctor :: (forall x y. BuildOp x y -> BuildOp' x y)
               -> BuildOp a b
               -> BuildOp' a b
buildOpFunctor t (ComposeOp g f) = ComposeOp' (t g) (t f)  -- Preserves composition
buildOpFunctor t (IdOp) = IdOp'                            -- Preserves identity
buildOpFunctor t (BuildStep f) = BuildStep' (transform f)  -- Base case

{-
6. Resource and Environment Properties
Properties to preserve:

Resource requirements: Memory, CPU, storage needs must be correctly mapped
Environment constraints: Build environment requirements and restrictions
Sandbox isolation: Security and isolation guarantees
-}

-- Current implementation traces:
data SandboxConfig = SandboxConfig
    { sandboxAllowNetwork :: Bool
    , sandboxExtraPaths :: Set FilePath
    , sandboxEnv :: Map Text Text
    , sandboxReadOnlyBindMounts :: Map FilePath FilePath
    }

CONCLUSION

Implementation Benefits for Ten
Explicitly modeling these functors would provide Ten with:

Formal verification capabilities: Mathematical proofs that transformations preserve essential build properties
Better composition laws: Clearer rules for how build operations can be combined while maintaining correctness
Optimization opportunities: Safe transformation of build graphs for parallelism while preserving correctness
Testing framework: Property-based tests that verify functor laws are maintained
Research platform improvements: Stronger foundation for experimenting with novel build system concepts
