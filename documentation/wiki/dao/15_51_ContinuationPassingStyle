Continuation Passing Style
CPS could improve Ten's build execution engine by making it more efficient and enabling advanced control flow:

Tail-recursive build execution would avoid stack overflows for large build graphs
Named continuations could simplify complex recovery mechanisms
Defunctionalization could provide optimization opportunities
