-- Coends for Dependency Resolution

{-
The coend formulas shown in the Dao book could formalize Ten's dependency resolution:
/D(P(a,a),d) â‰ƒ /D(P(a,a),d)
-}

-- Implementation opportunity: Model dependency paths as coends to ensure completeness and correctness:
type DependencyChain a = -- Using coends to model transitive dependencies
