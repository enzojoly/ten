{-
A Cartesian category is a category equipped with a product operation that satisfies certain properties.
In practical terms, it provides a formal foundation for working with product types in a composable way.
Relation to Ten: Ten's build system fundamentally operates as a Cartesian category where:

Objects are build artifacts and derivations
Morphisms are build transformations
The product structure represents how inputs combine to produce outputs

-- The graph structure in Ten implements this categorical structure:
haskelldata BuildGraph = BuildGraph
    { graphNodes :: Map Text BuildNode
    , graphEdges :: Map Text (Set Text)
    , graphRoots :: Set Text
    , graphProof :: Maybe GraphProof
    }

-- Improvement potential: Ten could make this categorical structure more explicit, perhaps by defining a proper category type class that formalizes the operations on builds.
