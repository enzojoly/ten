-- Functor Categories

{-
A functor category, often denoted as [C, D], has:

Functors from C to D as objects
Natural transformations between these functors as morphisms

This provides a way to organize and study the relationships between different functors.
-}
-- Ten could benefit from organizing its phase-specific operations into functor categories:

-- Could be modeled explicitly in Ten
type EvalCat = [Phase, Types] -- Category of evaluation-phase functors

type BuildCat = [Phase, Types] -- Category of build-phase functors

type PhaseTransform = [EvalCat, BuildCat] -- Transformations between phases

{-
While this structure isn't explicit in Ten's current codebase, organizing operations this way would:

Provide a clearer structural understanding of the system
Enable higher-order operations on transformations
Support more powerful abstraction mechanisms
