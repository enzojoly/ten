Simple phantom types for phase tracking: Light-weight but sufficient
Singletons AND Liquid Haskell: Verify dependency existence and SMT-gleaned details
Free categories for graph structure: Mathematical rigor for dependency relationships
Adjunctions for phase transitions: Formal relationship between phases
Liquid Haskell only for truly complex invariants: Resource limits, security properties
