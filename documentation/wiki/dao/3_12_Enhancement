Ten could be enhanced by more explicit adoption of category theory:

Functorial Build Design: Implement proper functors for build transformations
Monoidal Structure: Explicitly model parallel builds using monoidal categories
Free Constructions: Use free monads to model build sequences with optimization opportunities
Adjunctions: Model the relationship between evaluation and building as adjoint functors
Effect Systems: Implement algebraic effects for cleaner handling of build side effects
