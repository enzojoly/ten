-- Algebras from Endofunctors

-- Relation to Ten: Ten's core architecture uses F-algebras extensively. In src/Ten/Graph.hs, we see:

data GraphF a = NodeF a [a] -- Functor representing graph structure

type Graph = Fix GraphF -- Recursive graph type using fixed point

{-
This directly applies the concept of algebras from endofunctors where GraphF is an endofunctor in the category of Haskell types.

Ten uses this pattern to model its build dependency graph in a purely functional way, enabling powerful graph traversal algorithms and formal verification.

Potential Improvement:
Ten could expand its algebraic structure to support richer build dependency relationships using more advanced functors and natural transformations
