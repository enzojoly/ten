This complex monad stack can suffer from performance issues due to nested binds. The Yoneda lemma provides a technique (the "codensity transformation") to optimize such monads.

Ten could enhance its performance by:

Implementing a Yoneda-based codensity transformation
Using Yoneda to optimize monadic bind chains
Developing more efficient monadic operations
Reducing the overhead of the phase tracking system
