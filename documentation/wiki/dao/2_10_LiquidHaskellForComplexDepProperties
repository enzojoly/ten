Liquid Haskell becomes essential when verifying more sophisticated dependency properties:

Consistency checking: Verifying that dependencies don't have conflicting requirements
Transitive closure properties: Ensuring all indirect dependencies satisfy constraints
Version constraint satisfaction: Validating that version requirements are met
Resource bounds: Ensuring dependencies don't exceed system limitations
Dependency graph properties: Verifying acyclicity, reachability, etc.
