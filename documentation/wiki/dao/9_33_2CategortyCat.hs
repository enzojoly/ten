-- 2-category Cat

{-
A 2-category extends the notion of a category by including not just objects and morphisms, but also 2-morphisms (morphisms between morphisms).

The 2-category Cat has:

Categories as objects
Functors as 1-morphisms
Natural transformations as 2-morphisms

This structure allows for more sophisticated relationships between categorical structures.

-- Ten's phase system can be understood through 2-categorical structure:

-- From Ten.Core.hs
data Phase = Eval | Build

newtype TenM (p :: Phase) a = TenM
  {runTenM :: ReaderT BuildEnv (StateT BuildState (ExceptT BuildError IO)) a}

data Proof (p :: Phase) where
  -- Proofs for evaluation phase
  TypeProof :: Proof 'Eval
  AcyclicProof :: Proof 'Eval
  EvalCompleteProof :: Proof 'Eval
  -- Proofs for build phase
  InputProof :: Proof 'Build
  BuildProof :: Proof 'Build
  OutputProof :: Proof 'Build
  -- Composite proofs
  ComposeProof :: Proof p -> Proof p -> Proof p

{-
The phases form categories, the transitions between phases are functors, and the proofs can be seen as natural transformations.
This 2-categorical structure underlies the entire phase separation system.

Ten could enhance its design by:

Formalizing the 2-categorical structure of the phase system
Implementing advanced phase transition mechanisms
Developing more sophisticated proof composition techniques
Using 2-categorical laws for system optimization
