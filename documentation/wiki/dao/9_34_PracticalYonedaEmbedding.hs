-- Practical Yoneda Embedding for Ten Derivations

{-
The Yoneda embedding suggests a profound shift in how we represent derivations:
instead of storing a data structure with fields, we could represent a derivation by how it interacts with the build system.
-}

{- Current Approach vs. Yoneda Approach -}

{- Traditional Derivation (Current) -}
data Derivation = Derivation
    { derivName :: Text
    , derivBuilder :: StorePath
    , derivArgs :: [Text]
    , derivInputs :: Set DerivationInput
    , derivOutputs :: Set DerivationOutput
    , derivEnv :: Map Text Text
    }

{- Yoneda-Inspired Derivation -}

-- A derivation is represented by its interaction functions
newtype YonedaDerivation = YonedaDerivation
    { runWithInput :: forall a. (BuildInput -> TenM 'Build a) -> TenM 'Build a
      -- More interaction functions would be included here
    }

-- Creating a derivation means defining these interaction functions
createDerivation :: Text -> StorePath -> [Text] -> Set DerivationInput
                 -> Set DerivationOutput -> Map Text Text -> YonedaDerivation
createDerivation name builder args inputs outputs env = YonedaDerivation
    { runWithInput = \f -> do
        -- Logic to process each input
        results <- forM (Set.toList inputs) $ \input -> f input
        -- Return combined results
        return $ mconcat results
    -- Other interaction functions defined similarly
    }

{-
In the Yoneda approach, a derivation isn't a passive data structure - it's a collection of behaviors. This has several practical implications:

Identity by Behavior: Two derivations that behave identically in all contexts are considered the same, regardless of internal representation
Lazy Computation: Information about the derivation is computed only when needed
Optimized Representation: The representation can be tailored to the most common operations
-}

-- Here's a realistic implementation of Yoneda-inspired derivations:
-- Core representation
data DerivationF a = DerivationF
    { -- Key interaction functions
      withInputs :: (Set DerivationInput -> a) -> a
    , withBuilder :: (StorePath -> a) -> a
    , withOutputs :: (Set DerivationOutput -> a) -> a
    , withEnvironment :: (Map Text Text -> a) -> a
    , runBuild :: TenM 'Build BuildResult
    }

-- Type-safe wrapper
newtype YDerivation = YDerivation (forall a. DerivationF a)

-- Create from traditional representation
fromDerivation :: Derivation -> YDerivation
fromDerivation d = YDerivation $ DerivationF
    { withInputs = \f -> f (derivInputs d)
    , withBuilder = \f -> f (derivBuilder d)
    , withOutputs = \f -> f (derivOutputs d)
    , withEnvironment = \f -> f (derivEnv d)
    , runBuild = buildDerivation d
    }

-- Extract traditional representation if needed
toDerivation :: YDerivation -> Derivation
toDerivation (YDerivation df) = Derivation
    { derivName = df.withEnvironment $ \env ->
                    Map.findWithDefault "unnamed" "name" env
    , derivBuilder = df.withBuilder id
    , derivArgs = df.withEnvironment $ \env ->
                    maybe [] T.splitOn (Map.lookup "args" env)
    , derivInputs = df.withInputs id
    , derivOutputs = df.withOutputs id
    , derivEnv = df.withEnvironment id
    }

{- Here's where Yoneda embedding would provide genuine practical advantages: -}

-- 1. Efficient Dependency Tracking

-- Using Yoneda to efficiently track dependencies
dependsOn :: YDerivation -> StorePath -> Bool
dependsOn (YDerivation df) path = df.withInputs $ \inputs ->
  any (\input -> inputPath input == path) inputs

-- This is more efficient than accessing and filtering the entire input set when we only need to check a single dependency

-- 2. Lazy Hash Computation

-- Hash only computed when needed and cached thereafter
hashYDerivation :: YDerivation -> TenM p Hash
hashYDerivation yd@(YDerivation df) = do
  cachedHash <- lookupHashCache yd
  case cachedHash of
    Just hash -> return hash
    Nothing -> do
      -- Only compute full representation when needed
      let drv = toDerivation yd
      hash <- computeHash drv
      cacheHash yd hash
      return hash

-- 3. Structural Sharing

-- Efficiently create a variant with just the environment changed
withEnv :: YDerivation -> Map Text Text -> YDerivation
withEnv (YDerivation df) newEnv = YDerivation $ df
    { withEnvironment = \f -> f newEnv
    , runBuild = df.withInputs $ \inputs ->
                 df.withBuilder $ \builder ->
                 df.withOutputs $ \outputs ->
                 buildWith inputs builder outputs newEnv
    }

-- This reuses all other components without copying

-- 4. Optimized Build Phases

-- Each phase of the build can be optimized independently
evaluateYDerivation :: YDerivation -> TenM 'Eval EvaluationResult
evaluateYDerivation (YDerivation df) = df.withInputs $ \inputs ->
  df.withBuilder $ \builder ->
  df.withEnvironment $ \env ->
    -- Only access the components needed for evaluation
    evaluateWith inputs builder env

-- No need to access outputs during evaluation phase

{-
Benefits of Yoneda Implementation:

Performance Optimization: For large build systems with thousands of derivations, the lazy computation and structural sharing could significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance
Principled Caching: Derivations are semantically equivalent if they behave identically in all contexts, which provides a stronger foundation for caching
More Flexible Serialization: Different serialization strategies can be used depending on the context (network transfer vs. storage)

Costs:

Implementation Complexity: The Yoneda approach is more abstract and harder to understand for new developers
Debugging Challenges: Error messages might be less straightforward when using this approach
Integration Effort: Integrating with existing Nix ecosystem would require careful compatibility work
-}

{-
Practical Recommendation

Implement as an Alternative Representation: Keep the traditional representation but offer Yoneda as an optimization
-}

-- Toggle between representations
data OptimizedDerivation
    = Traditional Derivation
    | Yoneda YDerivation

-- Convert automatically as needed
asYoneda :: OptimizedDerivation -> YDerivation
asYoneda (Traditional d) = fromDerivation d
asYoneda (Yoneda y) = y

asTraditional :: OptimizedDerivation -> Derivation
asTraditional (Traditional d) = d
asTraditional (Yoneda y) = toDerivation y

{-
Benchmark Real-World Performance: Measure the impact on large build graphs before committing to the approach
Apply Selectively: Use Yoneda for parts of the system where the benefits are greatest (like dependency resolution)

This balanced approach would let Ten explore the theoretical benefits while maintaining compatibility with the broader Nix ecosystem.
The most valuable use case is likely in large-scale build systems where thousands of derivations are processed and memory efficiency becomes critical - exactly the scenario where Nix and Ten are designed to excel.
