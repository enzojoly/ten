-- Vertical Composition of Natural Transformations

{-
Given natural transformations η: F → G and ρ: G → H between functors F, G, H: C → D, their vertical composition (ρ ∘ η): F → H is defined component-wise: (ρ ∘ η)_X = ρ_X ∘ η_X for each object X in C.
This represents sequential application of the transformations.

Vertical composition could enhance Ten's proof system:
-}

-- From Ten.Core.hs
data Proof (p :: Phase) where
  -- Proofs for evaluation phase
  TypeProof :: Proof 'Eval
  AcyclicProof :: Proof 'Eval
  EvalCompleteProof :: Proof 'Eval
  -- Proofs for build phase
  InputProof :: Proof 'Build
  BuildProof :: Proof 'Build
  OutputProof :: Proof 'Build
  -- Composite proofs
  ComposeProof :: Proof p -> Proof p -> Proof p

{-
Ten already has a ComposeProof constructor which combines proofs, but it doesn't explicitly model vertical composition of natural transformations.

Restructuring the proof system to use natural transformations would:

Allow more flexible proof composition
Provide clearer semantics for proof combination
Enable verification of more complex properties
