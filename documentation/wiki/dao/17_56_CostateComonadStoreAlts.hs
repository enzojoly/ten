-- Alternative Approaches
-------------------------------------------------------------------
{-
1. Coreader Comonad
Another option is the Coreader (or Environment) Comonad:
-}

data CoReader e a = CoReader
  { getEnvironment :: e,
    getExtract :: a
  }

-- This would model the store as an environment with content. It's simpler but less powerful than Costate since it doesn't model the function aspect as directly.

{-
2. Traced Comonad
For stores with structured relationships, the Traced Comonad might be useful:
-}

data Traced m a = Traced
  { getTrace :: m -> a,
    getContext :: m
  }

-- This would be useful for modeling stores where derivations have complex interrelationships.

Implementation Strategy
To effectively implement the Costate approach:

Start with Core Abstractions: Implement the basic Store comonad
Add Optimization Layers: Introduce caching and performance optimizations
Refine Error Handling: Create principled error handling that maintains comonadic structure
Extend with Transformations: Add advanced operations that leverage comonadic transformations
