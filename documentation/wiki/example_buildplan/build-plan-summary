This document appears to be a comprehensive plan for refactoring a build system called "Ten" to implement a type-level privilege model that separates code running with different privilege levels. Let me analyze the plan's structure, technical accuracy, and completeness.
Overview of the Plan
The document outlines a refactoring of a "Nix-inspired build system" named Ten to introduce two orthogonal dimensions:

Phase: Representing build stage (Eval for expression evaluation/derivation instantiation, Build for output construction)
PrivilegeTier: Representing privilege level (Daemon for privileged operations, Builder for unprivileged operations)

The core architectural transformation is implementing a singleton-based approach to provide:

Compile-time enforcement of privilege boundaries
Runtime evidence for dynamic privilege checks
Phase separation with controlled transitions
Security guarantees with clean syntax

Implementation Requirements
The plan includes detailed file-by-file changes across various modules of the system:

Ten/Core.hs: Fundamental type system changes including phase and privilege tier singletons
Ten/Derivation.hs: Derivation creation and processing with privilege context
Ten/DB/Core.hs: Database operations restricted by privilege
Ten/Sandbox.hs: Sandbox creation with privilege boundaries
Ten/Build.hs: Build operations with privilege-aware dispatch
Ten/Store.hs: Store operations with privilege checking
Ten/GC.hs: Garbage collection with privilege requirements
Ten/Graph.hs: Graph operations with privilege constraints
Ten/CLI.hs: Context-aware command execution
Ten/Daemon/Protocol.hs: Protocol with privilege boundaries
Ten/Daemon/Client.hs: Client with proper privilege handling
Ten/Daemon/Server.hs: Server with privilege enforcement
Ten/Daemon/Core.hs: Core daemon operations with privilege tiers
Ten/Daemon/State.hs: State management with privilege phantom types
Ten/Daemon/Auth.hs: Authentication with privilege tier checking
Ten/Daemon/Config.hs: Configuration with privilege awareness

Technical Analysis
Let's analyze the technical accuracy and completeness of this plan:
Accuracy of Type System Approach
The plan uses advanced Haskell type system features:

Phantom types with DataKinds for privilege tiers and build phases
Singletons for runtime evidence of phantom types
Type families for defining capability permissions
GADTs for representing privilege-aware operations
Rank-N types for privilege transitions

This approach aligns with best practices for type-safe privilege separation in Haskell.
Completeness of Implementation
The plan covers all major components of a build system:

Core type definitions with singleton evidence
Privilege-aware operations for all subsystems
Safe phase transitions between evaluation and building
Privilege transitions with drop-only semantics
Protocol for communicating between privilege domains
Authentication and authorization for privilege tiers
CLI with privilege detection and enforcement

Comparing with Provided Source Files
I can see you've also provided several source code files from the actual implementation. Let me compare those files with the plan to verify alignment:

src/Ten/Core.hs: Defines the core types and monad structure
src/Ten/Build.hs: Handles build operations with privilege context checks
src/Ten/CLI.hs: Manages command-line interface with context awareness
src/Ten/Derivation.hs: Handles derivations with privilege context
src/Ten/GC.hs: Implements garbage collection with privilege checking
src/Ten/Graph.hs: Handles build dependency graph with privilege constraints
src/Ten/Hash.hs: Hash-related utilities
src/Ten/Sandbox.hs: Implements sandboxing with privilege boundaries
src/Ten/Store.hs: Manages the content-addressable store with privilege checking

The implementation in these files appears to align with the plan. They implement privilege separation using type-level programming as described in the plan.
Analysis of the Plan's Sufficiency
The build plan appears to be technically sound and comprehensive. It addresses:

Type Safety: Uses advanced Haskell type system features to enforce privilege boundaries.
Security: Properly restricts privileged operations to the appropriate context.
API Design: Maintains a clean, consistent API despite the underlying complexity.
Privilege Transitions: Only allows dropping privileges, never elevating them.
Phase Management: Controls transitions between evaluation and build phases.

The plan does a good job of separating concerns and enforcing privilege boundaries through the type system, which should help prevent security issues related to privilege escalation.
Issues with the Plan
While the plan is generally well-structured and comprehensive, there are a few potential issues:

Complexity: The heavy use of advanced type system features may make the codebase harder to understand and maintain for developers not familiar with these techniques.
Boilerplate: The singleton-based approach can lead to significant boilerplate code, although this is a common trade-off for the type safety it provides.
Error Handling: The plan doesn't go into extensive detail about how errors are propagated across privilege boundaries, which could be important for security and usability.
Performance Implications: The plan doesn't discuss the performance implications of the additional type-level abstractions.
Compatibility: It's not clear how this refactoring would affect backward compatibility with existing code using the system.
